# Monk:  Way of the Sun Soul
Monks of the Way of the Sun Soul learn to channel their own life energy into radiant sunlight. They teach that meditation can unlock the ability to unleash the indomitable light shed by the soul of every living creature.
:

### Level 3: Luminous Projection
You know the Dancing Lights Cantrip and can cast it without Verbal or Material components.

### Level 3: Radiant Sun Bolt
You can hurl bolts of magical radiance.

You gain a new attack option that you can use with the Attack action. This special attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls. Its damage is radiant, and its damage die is a d6. This die changes as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.

You can expend 1 Focus Point to make the special attack twice as a Bonus action.

When you gain the Extra Attack feature, this special attack can be used for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action.

### Level 6: Sunlight
As a Magic Action, you can spend 2 Focus Points to channel pure sunlight into objects. 

You touch an object and for the next 1 hour, sunlight spreads and fills a 30-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight. 

If any of this effect's area overlaps with an area of Darkness created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

### Level 6: Searing Arc Strike
You gain the ability to channel your focus into a searing wave of energy.

As a Bonus Action, you can expend 1 Focus Point to create a searing wave of energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking Radiant damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts Die on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

For each additional Focus Point you spend, up to a maxiumum number of points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), increases the number of Martial Arts die you roll by 1 and increases the size of the cone by 5 feet, up to a maximum of 30 feet.

### Level 11: Blinding Sunburst
You create a devestating burst of sunlight. As a Magic action, you can expend 3 Focus Points to create an orb and hurl it at a point you choose within 150 feet, where it erupts for a brief but deadly instant into a 20-foot-radius sphere of radiant sunlight. Alternatively, you can form a beam of sunlight in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long Line extending from you.

Each creature in that area makes Consitution saving throw, taking Radiant damage equal to 5 rolls of your Martial Arts die on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If a creature fails this save by 5 or more it also has the Blinded condition until the end of their next turn.

### Level 17: Solar Shield
You become wreathed in a luminous, magical aura of sunlight.

You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight. You can extinguish or restore the light as a Bonus action.

***Sun Shield.*** If a creature hits you with a melee attack while this light shines, the attacking creature takes Radiant damage equal to 5 + your Wisdom modifier. If the attack includes Radiant or Necrotic damage, you may also reduce the damage taken from that attack by the same amount.
